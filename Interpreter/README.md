## TLDR Sea++
> Sea++ is an Stack Based Language with interesting features:

> Data types and Operations
> Conditionals
> Recursion/loops
> Stack manipulation operations
> Procedures/functions with arguments
> Static type system
> Strings and operations

> This language uses stacks whenever it can.
> It is very focused on core features that work well, rather than expressionality.
> We hope you like the name as much as we do :)
